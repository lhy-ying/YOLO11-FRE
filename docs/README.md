# YOLO11-FRE: Enhanced Object Detection for Classroom Student Behavior Recognition

This repository contains the source code for the YOLO11-FRE model, which is proposed in the paper "Enhanced YOLO11-FRE: Real-Time and Accurate Student Behavior Recognition in Educational Surveillance" (submitted to *The Visual Computer*).

## üåü Highlights
- **Model Innovation**:
  - The backbone network is replaced with FasterNet, improving feature extraction efficiency while reducing computational load.
  - The RFAConv module is incorporated in the Neck layer to enhance multi-scale feature fusion.
  - The EMA attention mechanism is embedded in the C2PSA structure to focus on key behavior features and improve recognition accuracy.
- **Performance Improvement**:
  - Achieves an mAP50 of 86.7% (3.4% increase compared to the original YOLO11) on a self-constructed classroom behavior dataset.
  - Improves accuracy and recall by 1.7% and 3.4% respectively.
  - Balances accuracy and real-time performance, making it suitable for intelligent education surveillance scenarios.
